## 1. Introduction

This image aims to provide a CS:GO server to develop and test [get5](https://github.com/splewis/get5). 

Do not use this in production to run your matches!

Everything that can be changed about the server can be **set using environment variables** passed to Docker on container
creation.

If you want to use your local build you have to build it first using [this instructions](https://splewis.github.io/get5/dev/developers/#build)

For further information please read [the docs](https://splewis.github.io/get5/dev/). 

## 2. Using the image

### 2.1 Quickstart

1. Download the image from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev):
```
docker pull flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev:latest
```

2. Launch a container:
```
docker run --rm -it --network=host flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev:latest
```

### 2.2 Recommended Docker launch arguments

At minimum, you'll probably want to launch the container with the following environment variables set:

* `-it`: run the container interactive. There will be problems if you don't run it interactiveley.

* `--network=host`: use the host machine's ports and IP address, rather than running within an isolated Docker 
  network that's not visible to the outside world.

* `-e RCON_PASSWORD=<some other password>`: set the RCON (admin) password.

If you want to start the server with a loaded config, set:

* `-e MATCH_CONFIG=<your match config>`: start the server with the given JSON config loaded with Get5.

### 2.3 Examples

#### 2.3.1 Starting a server with no match config with your local get5 development build

Start a server with:
- The host machine's IP address 
- The specified port, GOTV port, password, RCON password, GOTV password

```
docker run --rm -it --network=host \
 -e GOTV_ENABLE=1 \
 -e PORT=1234 \
 -e GOTV_PORT=1235 \
 -e GOTV_DELAY=15 \
 -e PASSWORD=mypass \
 -e RCON_PASSWORD=adminpass \
 -e GOTV_PASSWORD=gotvpass \
 -e GET5_VER=LOCAL\
 -v $PWD/builds/get5:/localmounts/get5 \
 flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev:latest
```

#### 2.3.2 Starting a server with a match config

Start a server with:
- The host machine's IP address 
- The specified port, GOTV port, password, RCON password, GOTV password
- The given Get5 config loaded

```
docker run --rm -it --network=host \
 -e GOTV_ENABLE=1 \
 -e PASSWORD=mypass \
 -e RCON_PASSWORD=adminpass \
 -e GOTV_PASSWORD=gotvpass \
 -e GOTV_DELAY=15 \

## 3. Environment variables

Setting environment variables when starting a container allows you to manipulate the launch options of the server.

For example, `docker run -it -e PASSWORD=1234 flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev:latest` will start a new server with password `1234` 
by launching the server with `+sv_password 1234`. 

All possible environment variables are displayed in the table below.

| Variable name            | Launch option               | Description

Alternativeley you can set it to `LOCAL`, you can use the corresponding mountpoint ( see [below](#4-mountpoints) ) to mount an extracted version (default: false)
| SERVER_TOKEN             | `+sv_setsteamaccount`       | The Steam Game Server Login Token for this instance, required for the server to be accessible to non-LAN connections. Generate one [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) (default: not set, ie LAN connections only).
| PASSWORD                 | `+sv_password`              | Password required to connect to the server (default: not set)

| AUTOEXEC                 | `+exec`                     | A `.cfg` file to be executed on startup. Note anything you set here will probably be overwritten by Get5 when a match is loaded, so it's fairly useless (default: not set).
| UPDATE_ON_LAUNCH         | `-autoupdate`               | 1: Check for CS:GO updates on container launch, 0: do not check for updates. (default: 1)
| CUSTOM_ARGS              |                             | A string containing any additional launch options to pass to the dedicated server (default: not set)

Launch options are appended to the following set of basic launch options that are passed as arguments to `srcds`, the 
dedicated server program:
```

| :-----------------------      | :-------------------------- 
| /localmounts/servercfg        | If something is in here, the whole content will be copied recursive to the `cfg` folder of the srcds csgo folder and overwrites what is there right before the server starts.
| /localmounts/get5cfg          | If something is in here, the whole content will be copied recursive to the `addons/sourcemod/configs/get5` folder of the srcds csgo folder and overwrites what is there.

## 5. Keeping the image up to date

### 5.1 Updates on launch

By default, when a container is started from the image, it checks for CS:GO updates and installs them. Note that this 
will not modify your local copy of the image, so future containers will also have to download the update.
To disable checking for updates on launch, set the environment variable `UPDATE_ON_LAUNCH` to be `0`.

### 5.2 Scheduled and manual updates

For ensuring that an image contains the latest CS:GO version, two scripts are provided, one for local images and one for
the image in the DockerHub repo.
These can be run manually or at scheduled intervals. They run the following steps:
1. Check the version of CS:GO installed on the image 
2. If the version differs from the latest version of CS:GO according the Steam Web API, then a container is spawned 
   running `server-scripts/server-update.sh`, which installs CS:GO updates
3. The changes to the container are committed to the image and the image label updated to show the version of CS:GO 
   installed 
5. The image is pushed to the registry (`image_update/update-image-remote.sh` only)

The image updater scripts use `jq` to parse JSON objects from the Steam Web API. Install it using `sudo apt install jq`.

#### 5.2.1 Local version

To keep your local image up to date, you can schedule a `cron` job to run `updated-local-image.sh` at given intervals.
For example:

1. Run `crontab -e` to edit the crontab for the current user 
2. Add the following line to the opened file: 
```bash
10 * * * * /home/myuser/csgo-get5-docker-dev/update-local-image.sh > /home/myuser/csgo-get5-docker-dev/cron.log
```
This will run the script `/home/myuser/csgo-get5-docker-dev/update-local-image.sh ` at 10 minutes past the hour every hour, and 
log the output to `/home/myuser/csgo-get5-docker-dev/cron.log`.

#### 5.2.2 Version on DockerHub

The workflow ["Uses latest CS:GO version"](https://github.com/flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev/actions/workflows/check-csgo-version.yml)
checks that the version of CSGO on the image in the DockerHub registry matches the latest CS:GO patch released on Steam. If the versions missmatch, a issue is created here.

I run the `image_update/update-image-remote.sh` locally if nessecary and as soon as the docker hub is updated, i'll close the corresponding issue.

So if the image is already updated (which should happen soon after the release), you can simply run docker pull `flowingspdg/csgo-get5-docker-dev:latest` again to update.
